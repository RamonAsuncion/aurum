# Reference

Without the following resources, this project would not have been possible:

1. [CSCI 308 Programming Language Design at Bucknell University](https://coursecatalog.bucknell.edu/search/?P=CSCI%20308) The course that sparked my interest in programming languages.

2. [How I wrote a Lexer by Chirag Khandelwal](https://medium.com/young-coder/how-i-wrote-a-lexer-39f4f79d2980) I was interested in the lexcial output of the lexer.

3. [Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The book has great information on how to write a lexer.

4. [Stack-oriented programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language). I was reading on a couple of forums and found that stack-oriented languages are easier to implement.

5. [Direct Operating System Access via Syscalls](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs301/lecture/11_17_syscall.html) Some programming languages have the ability to access the operating system directly. I wanted to implement this feature in my language.

6. [Finite-state Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) x10 the speed of the interpreter instead of using a switch statement.

7. [Shifting Bits](http://lars.nocrew.org/forth2012/core/RSHIFT.html) How to shift bits in a number.

8. [Linux System Call Table](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md) The syscall numbers.

9. [While loop](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6949434/how-to-implement-loop-in-a-forth-like-language-interpreter-written-in-c) How to implement a while loop for my interpreter.

10. [Forth Keywords](http://lars.nocrew.org/forth2012/core.html) The keywords in Forth.

11. [Forth Stack Operations](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/2-stack-manipulation-operators-arithmetic/) Using the stack operations from Forth.

12. [Tsoding Daily](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily) Tsoding has a great series on making his own concatenative programming language.

13. [Jump Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table) to implement my interpreter. I was going to use a switch statement but I found that a jump table is faster and more efficient. The interpreter is 40,000 times faster.
